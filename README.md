#Dungeon Crawl

## Description

This is a 2D rogue-like game made with Unity and C#. Roguelikes are one of the oldest types of video games, the earliest ones were made in the 70s, they were inspired a lot by tabletop RPGs. Roguelikes have the following in common usually:

* They are tile-based.
* Usually the task is to explore a labyrinth and retrieve some treasure from its bottom.
* They feature permadeath: if you die its game over, you need to start from the beginning again.
* Are heavily using procedural generation: Levels, monster placement, items,.. are randomized, so the game does not get boring.

##How to Play

Use the arrow keys or WASD to move your character around the map. Collide with the enemies in order to attack them, but beware, you also take damage from them and press E to pick up items.

The goal of the game is to explore each level, defeat all enemies, and find the exit to progress to the next level. Be careful not to die, as death is permanent and you will need to start over from the beginning.
